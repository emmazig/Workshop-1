# Workshop-1

##LOOPS:
- Put the background in set-up  - so it doesn't draw the background over and over…?
- Use a while loop to repeat the rectangle until the end of the canvas - as long as “this” “that” will happen. 
- Change just x or y in loop so make rectangles go across or down and change x and y to make them go diagonally. OR just use x twice if a and y = the same thing

x   =  x  30     is the same as    x += 30
  x  = x + 1    is the same as    x = ++

For loop:    for( variable ; exit condition ; incrementation){
                        ‘ actual code like - rect etc’
                    }
##Making functions:

QUESTION: different spellings of colour + other little problems with colour

- Figure out what things you want to change each time you call the functions and what you want to stay the same, e.g width of rect or width of triangle.
- Couldn't figure out a way to have the trees move randomly on the x and y axis while the triangle and the rectangle stay together….?
- Use variables that make sense 
- Random numbers under colour gives you random colours
    - I decided to use fixed colours for my trees in the beginning function so they are always brown and green.
